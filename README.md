## Introduction

Pneumonia is a serious respiratory infection that affects millions worldwide, particularly young children and the elderly. Manual interpretation of X-rays is often slow and prone to error, especially in resource-limited settings. This project automates the detection of pneumonia from chest X-rays using a deep learning approach with VGG19, fine-tuned for binary classification (Pneumonia vs. Normal).

## Dataset

The dataset used is the publicly available **[RSNA Pneumonia Detection Challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/c/rsna-pneumonia-detection-challenge/data)** dataset from Kaggle. It contains 29,684 X-ray images, labeled as **Pneumonia** or **Normal**, and organized into training, validation, and test sets.

Key files:
- `stage_2_train_images/` - Training images
- `stage_2_test_images/` - Test images
- `stage_2_train_labels.csv` - Training labels

## Model Architecture

- **VGG19**: A 19-layer deep neural network that excels at extracting features from images.
- **Pre-trained Weights**: The model is initialized with weights from the ImageNet dataset, and the top layers are fine-tuned for pneumonia detection.
- **Modifications**: Additional custom layers such as GlobalAveragePooling2D and Dense layers are added, with Dropout applied for regularization. The output layer is modified for binary classification.

## Training and Testing

- **Preprocessing**: Images are resized to 224x224 pixels and normalized. Data augmentation techniques like rotation, zoom, and flipping are applied to prevent overfitting.
- **Training**: The model is trained with an 80/20 train-validation split using the Adam optimizer. EarlyStopping and Checkpoints are used to prevent overfitting and save the best model.
- **Transfer Learning**: The convolutional layers of VGG19 are frozen, and only the fully connected layers are trained for the pneumonia classification task.

## Results

- **Accuracy**: The model achieved an accuracy of 77.4% on the test set. The use of data augmentation and transfer learning contributed to the model's generalization capabilities.
- **Performance Metrics**: The results were evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and AUC-ROC.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the potential of transfer learning with VGG19 for early pneumonia detection using chest X-rays. The model provides high accuracy and could assist healthcare professionals in making quicker and more reliable diagnoses.

## Future Scope

- Experiment with advanced architectures like EfficientNet or transformer-based models.
- Incorporate additional clinical data to improve model performance.
- Expand the dataset to include diverse age groups and conditions for better generalization.
